                <p>BMI meter will check your health condition comparing your weight to your height and give proper
                    consultancy. I build the whole project alone. I build Responsive, pixel-perfect UI. Besides, I
                    manage the app state with Getx and important thing is this app is successfully live on google play
                    store. To build the app I rely on Figma, GitHub, Android Studio, and so on.</p>
